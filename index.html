							<h2>A brief history</h2>
							<p>
								In 1908, Corning Glass Works started making Nonex, a thermally
								resistant “non-expansion glass,” for railroad signal lanterns
								and other industrial applications. This clear glass moved into
								the kitchen through the efforts of Corning employee Jesse
								Littleton. As the origin story goes, he brought a sawed-off
								battery jar home to his wife Bessie, and she used the shallow
								mold to bake a cake. Capitalizing on the fact that the domestic
								sphere could benefit from the glass’s durability as much as the
								industrial world, Corning had a hit on its hands. By 1915, it
								was selling Pyrex pie plates, casserole dishes, and bakeware to
								the housewives of America. And despite the fact that many people
								hang onto their Pyrex pieces for a lifetime, it’s still selling
								and making its way into homes.
